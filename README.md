# Deep-Learning-For-Drug-Protein-Interactions
A Python implementation for training a neural network for predicting drug-protein interactions using Keras and Tensorflow

## Description
This repo contains 5 Notebooks that implement a Neural Network trained on drug-protein interactions from a subset of enzymes (Cytochrome P450) and drugs. The networks is trained to recognize substrates that are transformed by CYP450 enzymes


## Notebooks
Each notebooks is numbered according to the order in which they must be executed. The first Notebooks (1-4) deal with downloading, cleaning, and pre-processing the data using the KEGG API and Mole DB. 

The last Notebook shows the implementation of the Neural Network and how to visualize the results
